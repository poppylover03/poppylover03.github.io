            Happy 21st birthday to my love, my princess, my everything. You are what I think about when I fall asleep, while I sleep, when I wake up, and until I sleep again.
            You are my motivation, my pride, my treasure. Thank you for being you everyday and for making me, me.
        </p>

            1165 days together, yet it feels like much longer. You are now an official adult (in the US), which marks the beginning of our life together. In the next decade,
            life will move quickly, so lets make sure to slow down and appreciate the present and the memories we create. From our 2-month long Europe trip, to our graduations,
            to moving in together, to doing interior decoration of our apartment, to getting engaged, and to continue traveling together. I cannot wait for the adventures we go
            on together, and I am so thankful for those we have already done.
        </p>

        <p class="note-3">
            To end, here are some reason why I love you: you are beautiful (inside & out), you are kind to everyone, you are hilarious and fun to be around, you do not give up even 
            through your struggles, you are the most knowledgeable person I know, you have family and life goals, you have a jumbo booty & nice calcium cannons, and you genuinely care
            about your family, friends, and me. I could go on forever, but I will save the rest for your next birthday :), happy birthday and I hope you enjoy the rest of the plans I have
            prepared for you on your special day!
        </p>
